sideR has been described in the following manuscripts:

Bie. Interactive Visual Data Exploration with Subjective Feedback: An
Information-Theoretic Approach.

Reference to sideR:

Kai Puolamäki. sideR - a tool for subjective and interactive visual
data exploration in R. Downloaded from
<https://github.com/edahelsinki/sideR> on [insert date].

This is the current updated version of the software attached to the above mentioned manuscript.

-----

You need to have the following software installed before running
sideR:

* R 3.4.0 or higher with the following packages which can be installed
  from CRAN (see <https://www.r-bloggers.com/installing-r-packages/> for
  instructions): shiny, fastICA.
* A modern web browser such as Google Chrome.

We have tested sideR with a unix system (Mac OS X) but it should work
in any system that has R with the above mentioned packages installed.

NB: R 3.4.0 includes somes substantial speedups to matrix computations
which may affect the performance of the sideR. If you have an older
version of R installed we therefore strongly recommended you to update
to R 3.4.0 or newer!

-----

Run sideR by executing:  
`Rscript --vanilla run.R`
Then point your web browser to <http://127.0.0.1:7001>.

Run the runtime experiment by executing in directory runtime:  
`Rscript --vanilla runtime.R`  
Create the LaTeX table by executing in the same directory:  
`Rscript --vanilla report.R` 
Produce convergence figure by executing in directory toyexample:  
`Rscript --vanilla toyexample.R`
Produce usecases of data exploration and the respective figures 
by executing in directory usecases:
`Rscript --vanilla usecases.R`

How to get started by sideR:

sideR loads the BNC dataset by default. The BNC dataset contains
n=1335 documents which are represented by d=100 dimensional word
vectors. You can, e.g., mark a cluster you see on top right hand side
with your mouse, painting it red. If you make a mistake you can push
"clear current selection". Mark the selection as cluster constraint by
pressing "apply cluster constraint to current selection and
save". Wait a few seconds and hit "recompute background", after which
the background distribution is updated. When the computation is
finished you should see how the background distribution changed. You
can compute new PCA and ICA projections by pressing "compute pca
projection" and "compute ica projection", respectively. You can choose
the view (pca/ica/selection) by radio buttons.

You can view the classes and previously saved groupings by the
drop-down menu "add to current selection". The status line at the top
left corner shows concisely the Jaccard distance between the current
selection and clusters. E.g., from the top right cluster should
correspond quite well with the texts of the class
"Cconversation". Notice that from the axis of the scatterplot you can
see the projection vector in terms of the words (since we are here
dealing with text documents).

Use cases are described in the manuscript in more detail.

PS. Notice that due in Shiny the ordering of the update of global
variables is hard to enforce. This means that sometimes to update a
plot you should press "refresh all" button or swap between projections
(with radio buttons pca/ica/selection) a couple of time to force the
update.

-----

Adding a data set:

You can easily add a data set. You should make a dataset a R data
frame with no missing values. The columns that are factors
(is.factor(x) true) are automatically converted to class variables
visible in the dropdown menu. The other columns are assumed to be real
valued attributes. You should save the data file in directory
sideR/data and the data file should end with .rds after which it will
automatically be read into the dataset dropdown menu when sideR
starts.
